Abstract:Tourism gentrification is a problem that has affected many big tourist destinations and Mexico is one of them. This zine explores the different problems Mexico is facing because of tourism gentrification and it focuses on Mexico City, Mazatl√°n and Oaxaca. It explores specific examples in each place, the winners and losers and possible ways we can help minimize the effects of tourism gentrification in Mexico. The zine intends to shed light on a rising problem that affects many people as well as start discussion on how this problem can be resolved or at least managed.
