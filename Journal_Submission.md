Abstract: Tourism gentrification is a problem that has affected many big tourist destinations, and Mexico is one of them. This zine explores the various issues that Mexico City, Mazatlán, and San Miguel de Allende are facing. It highlights specific examples of displaced locals, the winners and losers, and how communities are fighting against gentrification. The zine aims to raise awareness about this escalating problem by presenting accessible, visually engaging, community-oriented storytelling.
